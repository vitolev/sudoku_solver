# Sudoku solver

An OCaml project that solves a given standard 9*9 sudoku. This project was a homework problem for students enrolled in Programiranje 1 at Faculty for Mathematics and Physics in Ljubljana in the year 2022/2023.

Even though I was never enrolled in this course I have decided to try and complete this problem by myself.
